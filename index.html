        <p>Electric cars are, for many, the alternative to internal combustion vehicles in terms of economy and ecology. Although, according to some studies, the production of electric batteries pollutes significantly, over its lifetime, the electric vehicle seems more responsible than a traditional car. Furthermore, to meet its climate goals, the French government aims to accelerate the transition from thermal to electric vehicles. To this end, several measures have been implemented, including various incentives for purchasing electric vehicles. For example, the ecological bonus is a financial aid granted for the purchase or lease of electric vehicles. Additionally, the conversion bonus provides support for replacing an old vehicle (usually a polluting thermal vehicle) with a new or second-hand vehicle that is less polluting, such as an electric vehicle. Local aid also exists, such as the subsidy implemented by the Saint-Étienne metropolis in the Loire region, France. This subsidy ranges from €5,500 to €16,000 for the purchase of a light electric utility vehicle.</p>

        <h2>GROWTH OF THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE FLEET</h2>
         <br>
        <p>To better understand the evolution of the electric vehicle fleet, it is useful to compare it with the evolution of the fleet of personal vehicles. A survey has been conducted in the Loire department from 2020 up to the present to understand the growth trends. Once the data is collected, it becomes possible to project how these trends will continue to evolve through 2030.
        The graph below shows a projection from 2024 to 2030, following the growth trend from 2023 to 2024, which stands at 124% for electric vehicles and 101% for personal vehicles.</p>

        <p>We observe a significant gap between the proportion of electric cars and the number of personal vehicles. This graph shows that by 2030, for approximately 3,360,000 personal vehicles, there would be only about 223,000 electric vehicles. This represents around 7%, a low percentage considering the French government’s target of 15% electric cars in the fleet by 2030. Achieving this goal would require a drastic increase in electric vehicles by 2030, with the annual growth rate rising from 124% to 140%.</p>
         <br>
        <h2>CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS</h2>
         <br>
        <p>This ambition to introduce more electric vehicles into the French fleet must be accompanied by an increase in charging stations to ensure that users can recharge their vehicles easily. This is why the government has set a goal of having one charging point for every ten cars by 2030, to keep up with the rise in electric vehicle purchases. Currently, 40% of electric vehicle users rely on public charging stations, but many do not find this necessary due to home charging options (65%). Nonetheless, the demand for public infrastructure is increasing, especially in urban areas.
        As it stands, based on available data and following the latest growth trend from 2024 (119%), projections show that the goal of one charging point per 10 electric vehicles will not be reached by 2030.</p>
    <!--<p>Graphique n°2</p>-->
    
        <img src="Images/Graphique 2.png" alt="Graphique 2" height="900" width="1550">
    
        <p>By 2030, we are expected to have 1,922 charging points for 223,052 electric cars, equating to roughly one charging point for every 116 cars. To meet the goal of one point per 10 cars, approximately 22,434 charging points would be needed in the Loire, as shown in the graph below. This represents a 169% increase in charging infrastructure compared to the previous increase of 119%.</p>

        <p>These figures indicate that the rollout of charging stations must accelerate to support the rapid growth of electric vehicles. The projections for 2030 highlight a significant gap between the required charging infrastructure and what currently exists, with the one-point-per-10-vehicles target still far from being achieved. However, current measures, such as the construction of public charging stations and home charging campaigns, are on the right track.</p>
